The things that will be implemented are:

- A modern and simple-to-use webpage
- Images of the city
- Public Institutions (Hospitals, Police Station)
- A easy way to check the different types of transport to reach the city
- The public transport with schedules the people use there
- A brief history of the village (& local traditions)
- An example of a tourist route
- Info about the city (Population, weatherâ€¦)

Beneficts once all that is implemented:
  
- Will attract the attention of tourists
- So the population could grow
- Could be a new target to stay near the capital, but cheaper
- Because of that, Lici could enrich oneself in culture
